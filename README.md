------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Model

The analysis is based on a **star schema** data model:

-   **Fact_Flight** ‚Üí Passenger Count, Airline, Date, Route (Origin &
    Destination Airports)
-   **Dim_Dates** ‚Üí Calendar attributes (Year, Month, Quarter, Week,
    Day)
-   **Dim_Airport** ‚Üí Airport details (Code, Name)

**Schema:**

    Dim_Dates ----< Fact_Flight >---- Dim_Airport

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìå Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Data into Model  
From [`complete_analysis.xlsx`](./complete_analysis.xlsx), the following tables were loaded into the **Power Pivot Data Model**:  
- `Fact_Flight`  
- `Dim_Dates`  
- `Dim_Airport`  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjust Data Types  
- `Fact_Flights[Date]` ‚Üí **Date**  
- `Dim_Dates[Date]` ‚Üí **Date**  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mark Date Table  
- Marked `Dim_Dates` as the **Date Table** (using the `Date` column).  
- Enabled **Time Intelligence Functions** in DAX.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sort Columns for Correct Order  
- `Month` sorted by `MonthNum` ‚Üí (*Jan, Feb, Mar‚Ä¶*).  
- `Day of Week` sorted by `WeekDayNum` ‚Üí (*Mon, Tue, ‚Ä¶*).  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Relationships Setup  
In **Diagram View**, established relationships:  

	Dim_Dates ----< Fact_Flight >---- Dim_Airport

---

### 6‚É£ DAX Calculations  

#### üîπ Calculated Columns  

**Store Type (Friendly Names)**  
```DAX
	Quarter = CONCATENATE("Qtr",  CEILING(Dim_Dates[MonthNum]/3,1))
```

```DAX
	OriginDestination = Fact_Flights[OriginAirport] & " - " & Fact_Flights[DestinationAirport]
```  

---

#### üîπ Measures  

```DAX
    PASUM:=SUM(Fact_Flights[Passenger Count])
```

```DAX 
    PASUMPY:=CALCULATE([PASUM], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Dates[Date]))
```

```DAX
    PAVSPY:=DIVIDE(([PASUM]-[PASUMPY]), [PASUMPY], "NA")
```

```DAX    
    PASUM_BIGWINGS:=CALCULATE([PASUM], Fact_Flights[Airline] = "BigWings")
```

```DAX    
    MarketShare_BIGWINGS:=DIVIDE([PASUM_BIGWINGS], CALCULATE([PASUM],  ALL(Fact_Flights[Airline])), 0)
```

```DAX
    MarketShare:=DIVIDE([PASUM], CALCULATE([PASUM], ALLSELECTED()), 0)
```
